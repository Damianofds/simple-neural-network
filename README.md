###What's this repo?

This repo is temporary used to gather small python projects about neural networks.

It's a fork of https://github.com/mattm/simple-neural-network since it was the first blog post reviewed.

The python programs are tested using:

* **Ubuntu 12.04.4**
* **Python 2.7.3** (default, Dec 18 2014, 19:10:20) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
* The **numpy** library
